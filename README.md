# Python-Api-Challenge

**Overview**

In this activity, I learned how to use Apis (Geofi and Openweather) to pull in data regarding geography and landmark data to create the following analysis.

* Graphs about Lattitude comparing (Wind speed, Temp, Humidity and cloudiness)
* Also created scatter plots and regressiom model to compare the weather mertics against Lattitdue 
*  Created a geography maps based on cities
* Further defined climate criteria and found hotels within 10K meter radius to our coordinates
* Then created a graph to define those cities with hotels if they were available
